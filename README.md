rio
========

## Rio is coming mid July.  Stay tuned for more info.

1. Simple as containers should be
1. As fun as Docker was 3 years ago
1. New shiny tech like service mesh
1. Built on the amazing power of k8s and you never have to see it if you don't want to

## Building

There is no chance you'll be able to get this to compile.  The vendor deps are a complete mess
right now and not checked in.  I'm still cleaning up a lot of hacks I've done, so that this
can compile with proper deps.

## Running

`./bin/rio`
